<br /> 

It's my note to understand the SVM with an example in Matlab code.

This code is a exaple how to use SVM in MATLAB using <a href="https://es.mathworks.com/help/stats/fitcsvm.html"> fitcsvm</a>.

The <b> SVM algorithm </b> aims to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can quickly put the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.
 The following image is the steps to understand the code and some code comments used in the code.

We can see the result here, with the 'x' cross are the data that we predict using the SVM.
