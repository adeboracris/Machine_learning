<br /> 

It's my note to understand the SVM with an example in Matlab code.

This code is a exaple how to use SVM in MATLAB using <a href="https://es.mathworks.com/help/stats/fitcsvm.html"> fitcsvm</a>.

The goal of the <b> SVM algorithm </b> is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.
