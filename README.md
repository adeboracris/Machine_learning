*A nice link  to study to do interviews in data science 

This repository is  notes to my studies to machine learning using MATLAB.

<br><br><b>Data Science:</b> An interdisciplinary field that uses data to generate insights and put it to use for the benefit of the business.<br><br>
<b>Machine Learning</b>: A part of artificial intelligence, systems that actually provide a framework to build sophisticated AI components. <br><br>

<b>Structured Data Classification</b>

Classification can be performed on structured or unstructured data. Classification is a technique where we categorize data into a given number of classes. The main goal of a classification problem is to identify the category/class to which a new data will fall under.

 Few of the terminologies encountered in machine learning â€“ classification:

  <b>Classifier: </b>An algorithm that maps the input data to a specific category.
 <br><b>Classification model:</b> A classification model tries to draw some conclusion from the input values given for training. It will predict the class labels/categories for the new data.
 <br> <b>Feature: </b>A feature is an individual measurable property of a phenomenon being observed.
 <br> <b>Binary Classification: </b>Classification task with two possible outcomes. Eg: Gender classification (Male / Female)
 <br> <b>Multi-class classification:</b> Classification with more than two classes. In multi class classification each sample is assigned to one and only one target label. Eg: An animal can be cat or dog but not both at the same time
<br> <b> Multi-label classification: </b>Classification task where each sample is mapped to a set of target labels (more than one class). Eg: A news article can be about sports, a person, and location at the same time.
